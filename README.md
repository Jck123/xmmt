# X-Box Modding Multi-Tool(XMMT)

## A one stop shop for all your X-Box modding needs!

This application is a school project I came up with and designed myself, inspired by the idea of a friend who would spend hours, days even, making sure all the games he was installing on modded Xboxes he sold were constantly running. This project makes use of Apache Commons, as well as XZ for Java libraries. This project was a real challenge in design and in making sure multiple cogs were working quickly and efficiently all at the same time.

### Running the Project yourself

This project, in it's current state, is not capable of running on it's own without an IDE. Future versions will provide an installer for a full program that can do all the work for you, using a robust GUI.

### Licesning

As of now, I do not wish to share this project with anyone. Please do not copy any of the intellectual property within this repository.
